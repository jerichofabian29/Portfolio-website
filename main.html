            <p style="text-align:center;text-align:justify;padding:1.5em;">I am a college student
                 from the main branch of Polytechnic University of the Philippines. I am currently 19 years old and I live in Pinagbuhatan Pasig City. I am aspiring to be a front-end 
                 developer and create innovative websites that can help my company. I always enjoy programming
                 and studying web development which is why I chose to take the course of Information Technology to further improve my skills in web development. I focus on front-end
                 development due to the fact that I love designing web pages through coding. I already made some basic projects to showcase my knowledge in web development. 
                 I am eager to embark on an internship as a front-end web developer to gain hands-on experience, contribute to exciting projects, and continue my journey in the ever-evolving
                 field of web development. I am confident that my skills, enthusiasm, and dedication make me an ideal candidate for this role.

                I have a basic knowledge about HTML5. I always use HTML when building personal projects related to web development. I utilize the use of this markup language to display all the 
                elements that I create using CSS. I have a basic knowledge of HTML, and it is a tool I consistently use when building websites. HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, serves as the
                bedrock of web development, and I rely on its fundamental principles to craft and structure web content.
                HTML's simplicity and versatility make it an indispensable resource in my web development journey. I have consistently harnessed its power to create the structural framework of web
                pages, defining the layout and content arrangement with tags like headings, paragraphs, and lists.

                    I have a foundational understanding of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and I consistently employ it to enhance the visual design and layout of websites.
                    CSS is an essential tool in web development, allowing me to create captivating and user-friendly web experiences. CSS plays a crucial role in shaping the
                    aesthetics of web pages. I leverage it to control various design aspects, such as fonts, colors, spacing, and alignment. This enables me to craft visually
                    appealing and cohesive web layouts that resonate with the intended audience. In my web development journey, I continually rely on CSS to bring creativity and
                    functionality to web design. Its role in refining aesthetics and maintaining code organization is indispensable.

                    I bring a robust understanding of the Bootstrap framework to my web development repertoire, leveraging its powerful grid system, components, and utilities. Proficient in crafting responsive designs, I ensure optimal user experiences across diverse devices. My expertise extends to seamlessly incorporating Bootstrap's extensive library of components, enhancing the efficiency of development while maintaining a polished aesthetic. Beyond utilizing its out-of-the-box features, I adeptly customize and extend Bootstrap to meet project-specific requirements. This combination of creativity and functionality results in dynamic, scalable, and visually appealing websites that adhere to the latest industry standards. Stay assured that my commitment to staying current with Bootstrap's advancements guarantees a forward-thinking approach to every project, promising a distinctive and exceptional user experience.

                    JavaScript is the pulse of my journey as a web developer. It's the language that breathes life into web pages, making them dynamic and interactive. In this essay, I'd like to
                    showcase my foundational understanding of JavaScript and the essential role it plays in web development.
                    JavaScript is the language that allows me to connect with users in real-time. I can validate form inputs, create engaging animations, and update content dynamically without
                    the need for a page refresh. It's the secret sauce that brings websites to life. JavaScript is my companion on this exciting journey in web development. It empowers me to create
                    engaging and dynamic web experiences. As I continue to explore and expand my knowledge of JavaScript, I look forward to pushing the boundaries of what I can create and the
                    interactive experiences I can provide to users.
